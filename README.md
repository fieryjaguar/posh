posh, short for Python Operating SHell, is a fully functional shell coded entirely in Python. How cool is that?

This shell is designed to be the most portable shell ever. It will first be implemented for Linux. After that feel free to send in pull requests for ANY operating system, any at all. I will review it and, if I like it, implement it. Also feel free to send in pull requests for ANY feature you think should be added. You can also send me a message about features to be implemented.

There is a file called TODO.txt. In that file you will find a list of bugs that need to be fixed, features that need to be implemented, and OS's to be ported to.
